==

rorrim is a tiny server that allows offline development without
dependencies on CDN's

Simply install with `npm install -g rorrim`

Then run `rorrim`
Eventually it will be easier to add stuff to the hosts directory,
but for now you'll need to copy files into a directory
under `~/.rorrim/hosts` named the same as the hostname
for example `~/.rorrim/hosts/cdnjs.cloudflare.com`

Running `rorrim --help` will show you some basic usage
